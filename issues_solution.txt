1. Istalled gnome-terminal using pacman but I was not able to launch the terminal. When tried to launch it through another terminal(xterm) it showed error: failed to creat DISPLAY_ID... and something about the proxy.

Solution: 1 -> Via GUI 
			Simply go to settings->region and languages.
			change the language to english.
			Logout your session and on login again you will be able to lauch the gnome-terminal.

	  2 -> Via command line: If you have another terminal you can create a file named locale.conf in /etc.
			Now paste the given line in that file.

			LANG=en_US.UTF-8
			
			save and exit.

			If you dont have terminal you can do same thing bypressing Ctl+Alt+F1 etc.
